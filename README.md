Objective
The primary goal of this quiz game is to create an interactive learning experience where users can answer multiple-choice questions, receive immediate feedback, and track their score. It is designed as a fun and educational tool to test knowledge across various topics in a simple, engaging way.


Key Activities

1. Question Display: Sequentially presents each question to the user in a readable format.
2. Answer Input and Validation: Accepts the user’s answer, checks if it matches the correct answer, and provides immediate feedback.
3. Score Tracking: Keeps a count of correct answers to calculate the user’s score.
4. Feedback and Results Display: Shows a final score and personalized feedback based on performance, encouraging users regardless of their score.


Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
1. I/O Operations: std::cout and std::cin for displaying questions and receiving input.
2. Functions: askQuestion() and showResults() to modularize the code, making it easy to maintain and scale.
3. Data Structures:
Arrays: Used for storing questions and answers, allowing for straightforward retrieval during the quiz.

Key Insights
1. Modular Code Structure: By using functions like askQuestion() and showResults(), the code is more organized and scalable. Additional features, like category selection or randomized questions, can be easily integrated without major refactoring.
2. User-Friendly Design: Immediate feedback for each question and final, encouraging feedback after the quiz keeps the user engaged and motivated to try again if they miss questions.
